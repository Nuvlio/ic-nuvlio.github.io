**Pre-Underwriting Analysis** - For every credit contract a submission that is realized in the screening phase, 
and aim to provide to user the capacity of judge all aspects that can affect the credit contract with the aspects of:

1. **_Environmental Aspects_** - the history of the field under analysis of land use, land cover change, deforestation, 
fires presence, flood risks, conflict with forests and other environmental metrics. This metrics enable for your 
organization to run commodities credit contracts compliant with the highest modern standards of any country on Earth.

2. **_Agronomic/Productive Aspects_** - covering the behavioral history of the field under analysis related to the 
production capacity and performance like what type of crop was cultivated in each year since 2000, what percentage of 
the field have been cultivated during each year, what have been the production performance in each season and other 
30+ specific metrics related to the production condition of the field. The production history not only implies the 
losses risks, but impacts the revenue capacity generation too.


3. **_Financial/Risk Aspects_** - the financial and risks metrics and analysis cover all critical decision points that 
will drive approval-rejection and rating-pricing of each contract. For example, the Nuvlio Oracles Services provide for 
financial/risk segment over 40+ different metrics, like a) weather risks, b) production score, c) default risk score, 
among others. With the information from this segment your organization can price and decide the acceptance of the contract. 


4. **_Reports Information_** - For each one of these segments of the analysis (Environmental Aspects, 
Agronomic/Productive Aspects, Financial/Risk Aspects) is aggregated as one set of reports documents that summarized that 
enables users to share information with all necessary peers for a contract in commodities lending. In each report is 
separated by its segment and cover all the metrics, visualizations and scores that drive the decision of that particular 
a segment.

**During the Cycle of Contract Analysis** - For each contract analyzed and approved in the **Pre-Underwriting Analysis** 
continue to be monitored and analyzed during the cycle of the contract (in commodities typically between 6 and 18 months) 
and during the time interval with a frequency of 15 to 30 days, are generated similar monitoring evaluations that cover 
all same three aspects analyzed (**_Environmental Aspects_**, **_Agronomic/Productive Aspects_**, 
**_Financial/Risk Aspects_**, **_Reports Information_**) with focus in assuring the contract can be managed in accordance 
of expected in the **Pre-Underwriting Analysis**, so making the data driven processing and management a reality for 
financial players in the commodities markets.

**Adverse Situations Alert Service** - During the cycle of each credit contract in case of any adverse event (like 
fires presence, deforestation, lack of production of expected on the field, among different evaluations) that can generate 
negative impacts on the expected outcome. 

**Target Crops Available** - As per 2023, the available crops that can be used as target for credit contracts 
analysis in any country around the globe, are:


      a) Soybean
    
      b) Corn
