among others. With the information from this segment your organization can price and decide the acceptance of the contract.

Agronomic/Productive Aspects, Financial/Risk Aspects) is aggregated as one set of reports documents that summarized that 
enables users to share information with all necessary peers for a contract in commodities lending. In each report is
